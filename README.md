I used Tailwind CSS for styling, which made it super easy to manage the layout and
responsiveness. Added several logo cards positioned around the text.They are strategically
positioned around the central text to create a balanced and dynamic layout. Visit: https://ideasgalore.netlify.app/

I used Tailwind CSS to style the page, which made it super easy to create a responsive layout. The
background has this gradient that transitions from purple to blue.To make the page stand out, I
included two floating card images on the right side. These cards have a subtle floating animation
that I created using custom CSS keyframes ,the front card floats up and down smoothly, while the
back card has a slight delay in its animation. Visit: https://aiautomationete.netlify.app/
